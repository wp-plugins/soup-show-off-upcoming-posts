### Welcome to the GitHub Repository

SOUP creates a widget in your sidebar which allows you to display your upcoming posts (scheduled, drafts, or both) to your readers. The idea is to entice your readers to come back and read the article once it gets published, or better yet, subscribe to your RSS feed and/or newsletter.
