Displays your upcoming posts in a sidebar widget to tease your readers

== Description ==

**Like this plugin?** Consider [leaving a quick review](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/soup-show-off-upcoming-posts "Review SOUP") or writing about how you've used it on your site - [send me a link](https://www.theukedge.com/contact/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=contact "Contact Dave") to that write up if you do.

This plugin is maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/theukedge/soup-show-off-upcoming-posts), so feel free to use the repository for reporting issues, submitting feature requests and submitting pull requests.

SOUP creates a widget in your sidebar which allows you to display your upcoming posts (scheduled, drafts, or both) to your readers. The idea is to entice your readers to come back and read the article once it gets published, or better yet, subscribe to your RSS feed and/or newsletter.

Here are the configurable options for the widget:

* Title of sidebar widget
* Number of upcoming posts to display (always in ascending order - newest first)
* Which categories to display posts from
* Choose whether to show scheduled posts, drafts, or both.
* Display order of the posts (next post first or random order)
* Message to display for when there are no scheduled posts or drafts
* Show/hide newsletter link
* Include link to sign up to newsletter

The plugin has been translated to Spanish (es_ES - thanks to Andrew Curtis) and Farsi (fa_IR - thanks to Saeed Adel Mehraban).

I've got plans to continue developing and updating this plugin. If you have any suggestions on revisions that you'd like to see made, please [get in touch](https://www.theukedge.com/contact/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=contact "Contact Dave") or [find me on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/daclements "Dave on Twitter").

I also run [Do It With WordPress](http://www.doitwithwp.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=my-other-sites "WordPress Tutorials"), which has an array of tutorials for managing, modifying and maintaining your WordPress sites, as well as [The WP Butler](https://www.thewpbutler.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=wordpress-services "WordPress Maintenance Services"), a service for keeping your site maintained, backed up, updated and secure.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there more features planned in future? =

Absolutely. I'll be providing more options and upgrades in the near future. You can stay up to date by following me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/daclements "Dave on Twitter"). If you have an idea for a new feature, you can create a new feature request on [GitHub](https://github.com/theukedge/soup-show-off-upcoming-posts/issues). If you don't have a GitHub account, then [tell me](https://www.theukedge.com/contact/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=contact "Contact The UK Edge") what this widget should do that it doesn't currently.

= I don't have a newsletter. Is this functionality lost on me? =

Many WordPress users send their RSS feed through FeedBurner, which has the option to deliver your latest posts by email to anyone who subscribes. Just log in to FeedBurner, go to the Publicize tab and select Email Subscriptions where you'll be able to grab the link.

= I'm having issues. What do I do? =

The best thing to do is to submit an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/theukedge/soup-show-off-upcoming-posts/issues). If you don't have a GitHub account, then [get in touch with me](https://www.theukedge.com/contact/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=contact "Contact The UK Edge") and I'll see about getting it fixed.
