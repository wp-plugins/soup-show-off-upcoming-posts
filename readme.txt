Displays your upcoming posts in a sidebar widget to tease your readers

== Description ==

SOUP creates a widget in your sidebar which allows you to display your upcoming posts (scheduled, drafts, or both) to your readers. The idea is to entice your readers to come back and read the article once it gets published, or better yet, subscribe to your RSS feed and/or newsletter.

Here are the configurable options for the widget:

* Title of sidebar widget
* Number of upcoming posts to display (always in ascending order - newest first)
* Which categories to display posts from
* Choose whether to show scheduled posts, drafts, or both.
* Display order of the posts (next post first or random order)
* Message to display for when there are no scheduled posts or drafts
* Show/hide newsletter link
* Include link to sign up to newsletter

I've got plans to continue developing and updating this plugin. If you have any suggestions on revisions that you'd like to see made, please [get in touch](http://www.theukedge.com/contact/ "Contact Dave at The UK Edge") or [find me on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/daclements "Dave on Twitter").

I also run [Do It With WordPress](http://www.doitwithwp.com "WordPress Tutorials"), which has an array of tutorials for managing, modifying and maintaining your WordPress sites.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `soup-show-off-upcoming-posts` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to Appearance > Widgets to put the widget in your selected sidebar.
1. Set your settings, hit Save and go to your site to see it in action.
