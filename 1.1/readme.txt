Displays your upcoming posts to tease your readers

== Description ==

SOUP is a simple plugin that creates a widget which will show off your upcoming (scheduled) posts to your readers, which allows you to create interest for readers to return to your site and read your future articles.

At the moment, the plugin has just two configurable options: number of posts to display and widget title. However, I plan to keep developing this plugin and adding functionality.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `soup-coming-post` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to Appearance > Widgets to put the widget in your selected sidebar
